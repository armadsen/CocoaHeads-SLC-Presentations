# Intro to Concurrent Programming

I gave an Introduction to Concurrent Programming talk at CocoaHeads SLC on November 1, 2016. Here are slides for the talk and a playground used for some demos. A more complete demo project used as part of the talk can be found at [https://www.github.com/armadsen/Rover](https://www.github.com/armadsen/Rover).
